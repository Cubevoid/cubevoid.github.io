Hi! My name is Colin De Vlieghere, and I am a fourth-year computer science specialist (with focus in AI) and mathematics minor at the University of Toronto.

I am passionate about coding and technology, and I love discovering and using cool tech! I primarily code in Python, although I also have experience in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, C, C++, R, and MIPS Assembly. To see some of my projects, please go to my [GitHub page](https://github.com/Cubevoid?tab=repositories).

My hobbies include gaming, Ultimate Frisbee, tennis, and tinkering with computers.

Feel free to contact me by email at [colin.de@mail.utoronto.ca](mailto:colin.de@mail.utoronto.ca) or through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colin-de-vlieghere/)!
