My name is Colin De Vlieghere, and I am a fourth-year computer science specialist (with focus in AI) and mathematics minor at the University of Toronto.
I am passionate about coding and technology, and I love discovering and using cool tech! I have significant experience in Python, C, and C++, although I also have experience in Java, Kotlin, JavaScript, R, and (MIPS) Assembly. To see some of my projects, please go to my GitHub page.</description></item><item><title>Projects</title><link>https://colindv.xyz/projects/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://colindv.xyz/projects/</guid><description>My longest ongoing project has been my server which I run at home.
I bought some ten-year-old HP Enterprise server on eBay and simply slapped in some new hard drives!
On it, I run my personal Nextcloud instance, multiple Minecraft servers connected using Bungeecord, a Spotify statistics tracker, a photo library, and more.
I use Nginx to reverse-proxy the public-facing web services like Nextcloud, but the traffic first passes through Cloudflare as a proxy.</description></item></channel></rss>
